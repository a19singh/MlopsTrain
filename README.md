Automating Deep Learning model training

## Introduction 

This is the era where every Computer Science Student is looking forward to be a Data Scientist. Their job heavily involves using the data to make predictions. But there is a lot of manual things which needs to be done like hyperparamater tuning. So why not just automate it?

To have a better understanding of idea, do checkout my blog on [medium](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/tuning-the-hyperparameter-thus-automating-deep-learning-model-a15e55ff5563) that contains automation of hyperparameter tuning using python and devops.
